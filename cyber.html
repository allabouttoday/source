					<p>The faster we are moving towards the digital world, the more the number of cybercrime is increasing. A recent example of this is the cyber attack on Australia's communications system, which disrupted the governance system's communication
						system. Cyber experts have also expressed apprehension of a major cyber attack in India.
					</p>
					<p>Cyber-attacks have been taking place in India in the past with increasing frequency. For example, the leaking of personal data of 3.2 million debit cards of bank account holders in 2016, and this data theft was a major cyber attack in
						India.</p>
					<p>Currently, the cybersecurity strategy has become an integral part of national security. Its area of influence is the same as that of the military influence area, and it plays a vital role in all aspects- governance, economy, and welfare
						of a country. Today, the Internet is a big part of our daily life. The concept of cybercrimes has also evolved along with the development of the Internet.</p>

					<h2>What is Cybercrime?</h2>
					<img class="image main" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1510511459019-5dda7724fd87?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MjF8fGN5YmVyJTIwc2VjdXJpdHl8ZW58MHx8MHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=60" alt="">
					<p>Cybercrime can be committed in various forms. A few years ago, there was a lack of awareness about crimes committed through the Internet. But today, India is not far behind the countries, and the people are aware and cautious of
						cybercrimes.</p>
					<p>The cases of cyber crimes are increasing day by day. In a situation of cybercrime, a cybercriminal can use a device to disable a user's personal information, confidential business information, government information, or a device. Selling
						or buying the above information online is also a cybercrime.
					</p>
					<p>This is a criminal activity, which is carried out by the use of computers and the Internet. Cybercrime, also known as 'electronic crime'- a crime in which a computer, network device, or a network is used as an object or device to commit
						a crime.</p>

						Improvement in the infrastructure of cybersecurity is the need of the hour
					</h2>

					<h3>An integral part of national security

					<ul>
						<li>The change in military principles in favor of the need to increase cyber command reflects the importance of changes in a cybersecurity strategy.</li>
						<li>The change in military principles in favor of the need to increase cyber command reflects the importance of changes in a cybersecurity strategy.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>The increasing importance of the digital economy</h3>
					<p>Currently, 14-15 percent of India's economy is included in the digital economy, and it's targeted to reach 20 percent by the year 2024.</p>
					<h3>A complex domain</h3>
					<p>Cyberspace has become a prominent domain due to the inclusive nature of Artificial Intelligence-AI, machine learning -ML, data analytics, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things ( IoT ), Which will give rise to problems of technical
						and legal nature.
					</p>
					<h3>Data protection challenge</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Data is as vital as currency in the 21st century. Due to India's large population, many international companies (Google, Amazon) are trying to set up their businesses.</li>
						<li>Therefore data sovereignty, data localization, and Internet governance are necessary to solve the issues related to the others.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Challenges faced by Cybersecurity </h2>
					<p>There is a lack of skilled people in Indian military forces, central police organizations, law enforcement agencies to understand the technical aspects related to various software and hardware required for this field. Also, artificial
						intelligence (Artificial Intelligence-AI ), Blockchain Technology (BlockChain Technology-BCT), Machine Learning ( Machine Learning -ML ), data analytics, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things ( Internet Of Things IoT- of-the-art
						technical facilities).</p>
					<p>here is a shortage of some brilliant and intellectual professionals. According to many experts, at least three million cybersecurity professionals are required. A few of the challenges faced are as follows:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<h3>Lack of active cyber defense</h3>
							<p>
								India lacks active cyber defense like the General Data Protection Regulation- GDPR or the US 'Clarifying Law Full Overseas Use of Data ( CLOUD ) Act.

							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Lack of coordination in the functioning of regulatory organizations
							</h3>
							<p>The United States, Singapore, and Britain have only one organization working in the field of cyberspace while India has several central bodies that deal with cyber issues and thus, each body has a different reporting structure, which
								lacks uniformity in the functioning of regulatory organizations.

							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Dependence on other countries for cybersecurity devices
							</h3>
							<p>There is a lack of indigenization in hardware as well as software cybersecurity devices in India. This weakens India's cyberspace in combating cyberattacks inspired by state agents and non-state agents.

							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>External challenges</h3>
							<p>
								Social media is becoming a powerful tool of 'information' dissemination, causing misleading news to spread rapidly, which continues to pose a cybersecurity threat.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>

					<h2>Government's efforts towards cybersecurity</h2>
					<p>The 'Information Technology Act, 2000' was passed in India, the provisions of along with the provisions of the Indian Penal Code are sufficient to deal with the effects of cyberattacks. Sections 43, 43A, 66, 66B, 66C, 66D, 66E, 66F, 67,
						67A, 67B, 70, 72, 72A and 74 of the Information Technology Act 2000 are regarding hacking and cybercrimes.
					</p>
					<p>The National Cyber Security Policy, 2013 was released by the government under which the 'National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Center-NCIIPC) was formed for the protection of ultra-sensitive information. Under this,
						there is also a provision for life imprisonment from 2 years and punishment or fine. Intending to develop human resources in the field of information security at various levels, the government has launched the' Information Security
						Education and Awareness: ISEA' project.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN) was made the nodal agency for analyzing, predicting, and warning cybersecurity threats.
					</p>
					<p>
						A 'Cyber Cleanliness Center' has also been established to deal with cybercrimes in a coordinated and effective manner in the country. It is a part of the Digital India campaign of the Government of India under the Ministry of Electronics
						and Information Technology-MeitY. India is coordinating with countries like the US, UK, and China to adopt best practices in terms of information sharing and cybersecurity.
